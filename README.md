# Student Feedback Points and Tracking System

**Project Objective:**\
Develop a console system that allows the course instructor to track student’s active feedback progress. 

**Key Features:**\
a. Feedback Forms:
Design feedback forms that will only collect feedback points. 

b. Tracking System: 
Create a mechanism to track students' progress. 

c. Report Generation:
Implement a reporting feature that allows the instructor to generate comprehensive reports on 
individual student performance for active feedback. 

d. Notifications: 
Implement embedded security measures in the instructor’s account using file permissions to 
control feedback. 

e. User Interface: 
Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the instructor. Ensure accessibility and 
responsiveness across various devices. 

f. Deliverables: 
A fully functional web application hosted on a server accessible to the instructor. Documentation 
includes a user guide and any additional information needed for future maintenance. 

g. Evaluation Criteria: 
Use dialog – geeksForgeeks.org/shell-scripting-dialog-boxes. 

**This is a straight Unix shell scripting hence there’ll be no need for backup development.**
